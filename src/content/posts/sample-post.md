Film photography from travels through Central Europe in autumn 2025. Shot on Nikon S3 with Kodak Portra 400 and Fuji 400.

These images capture the transition from day to night—the blue hour when artificial lights begin to compete with fading natural light, and the rich colors of autumn create warmth against cooler urban tones.
